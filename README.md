# NFPscanner-webserver
Network Fingerprint Scanner (NFPscanner) is a web server to decipher biomedical networks by making systematic comparisons to well-studied basic networks. A given biomedical network is characterized as a spectrum-like vector called “network fingerprint”, which contains similarities to basic networks. The similarity is measured by conservations of protein-protein interactions (PPI), sequence and functional annotations. This knowledge-based multidimensional characterization provides an intuitive way to decipher molecular networks, especially for large-scale network comparison and clustering analyses.
